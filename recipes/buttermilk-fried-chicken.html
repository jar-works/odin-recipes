        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Gather the ingredients. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the buttermilk soak: In a large bowl, combine the buttermilk with the salt, black pepper, and cayenne. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Set a rack on a baking sheet. Working with one piece at a time, remove the chicken from the buttermilk soak, letting the excess drip back into the bowl. Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture, pressing so it adheres all over. Transfer the coated chicken to the rack and let stand for 30 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                In a deep skillet, heat 1 inch of the oil to 350°F. Set another rack over a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Fry the chicken in batches, maintaining the oil temperature at 315°F; turn once, until golden and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of each piece registers 160°F, 15 to 18 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the chicken to the rack and let stand for 5 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Enjoy warm or at room temperature.
