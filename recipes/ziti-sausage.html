            <li>3 cups of your favorite spaghetti</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Romano cheese, divided</li>
            <li>8 ounces mozzarella cheese, diced small (1/4-inch)</li>
            <li>4 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded (about 1 cup)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9×13-inch baking dish; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook pasta to al dente according to the package directions. 
                Drain and put into a large bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the pasta is boiling, 
                cook the sausage in a large skillet over medium heat 
                until cooked through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the sausage from the pan with a slotted spoon 
                and add to the bowl with the pasta.
            </li>
            <li>
                Toss the pasta and sausage with the sauce, sausage,
                 ½ cup of the Romano cheese, and the diced mozzarella.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the mixture into the baking dish, sprinkle with the 
                remaining ½ cup Romano cheese and the shredded mozzarella. 
                (Make-Ahead Note: At this point, you can tightly cover the 
                pan with foil and refrigerate for up to one day or freeze 
                for up to 3 months. If frozen, place in the refrigerator 
                the day before you plan to bake and then bake according to 
                the directions below.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake, covered, for 45 minutes, until heated through and the 
                cheese is melted. Uncover, increase the oven temperature to 
                375 degrees F, and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes until 
                sauce and cheese are bubbling.
